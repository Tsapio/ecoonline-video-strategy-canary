He stumbles back into frame, smoking slightly.\n**Voice (super-fast, breathless):** "Okayokayokay—DEEP BREATHS—it's not the fall, it's the sudden ZZZAP AND THE ELECTROCUTION! See?! Frayed cord! Big ouch! I'm fine! My feathers will grow back! I think! JUST CHECK THE CORDS SO I CAN LOWER MY HEART RATE TO A MERE 500 BEATS PER MINUTE!"` },

A single drop of water lands near him. He screams, jumps into a tiny bunker, and slams the door.\n**Voice (yelling from the bunker):** "IT'S NOT A SUGGESTION! IT'S A THREAT! A pictionary of doom! That little circle is promising a world of hurt and loud noises! READ THE LABEL BEFORE—IS THAT RAIN?!—IT ERASES YOU FROM EXISTENCE!"` },

A shadow of a "CO2" boot crushes it. He falls to his knees, cradling a single, cracked acorn. He looks at the camera, a single tear rolling down his cheek.\n**Voice (dramatic, sobbing):** "Acorn-opolis... gone. Reduced to splinters. Your emissions aren't just numbers; they're the shattered dreams of squirrels everywhere! Do you hear their tiny cries?! I do! THEY HAUNT ME!"` },

The Canary pulls out a massive binder, trips, and it lands on the smoke, smothering it. He then can't lift the binder off. He's trapped.\n**Voice (straining):** "Okay, crisis averted by... clumsiness. BUT NOW I'M TRAPPED! Under the plan! The irony is crushing me! Literally! Put the plan on your phone! It's lighter!

It suddenly springs to life and folds him up inside it like a pretzel. Two little feet stick out the top.\n**Voice (muffled):** "I KNEW IT! This isn't a ladder, it's an ambush predator! Three points of contact means nothing if the tool itself is plotting against you! TAG IT OUT BEFORE IT GETS YOU, TOO!"` },

He accidentally mixes Bleach and Ammonia. A green cloud appears. When it clears, his feathers are bright pink and standing on end.\n**Voice (squeaky, coughing):** "FOR SCIENCE! ...I have made a terrible mistake. This is not a super-cleaner, it is a super-regret! My voice is now higher than my anxiety! Which is saying something! Read the SDS!"` },

He gets a cramp and starts sinking.\n**Voice (panicked):** "It's a sea of profit! But it's also a legitimate drowning hazard! Good ESG is good business, but manage your risk! I can't feel my wings! SEND HELP AND A TINY LIFE PRESERVER!"` },
                 { week: 5, day: 'Thu', pillar: 'Lone Worker', title: "Your Phone Died. So Might You.", script: `**Visual:** The Canary’s phone battery dies. The lights in the room go out one by one, leaving him in a single, terrifying spotlight. He whimpers.\n**Voice (terrified whisper):** "Darkness... my old friend. Why is it so... menacing? A dead phone is the start of every horror movie! Charge your lifeline! I think... I think something touched my foot!"` },

The Canary runs back to grab his favorite seed bell, but a tiny sprinkler system activates directly above him, soaking him completely. He stands there, dripping and defeated.\n**Voice:** "My bell! It was the good kind with the millet! It's ruined! But I'm not! Your stuff can be replaced. You can't! And neither can my seed bell, but my point still stands! JUST GET OUT!"` },

He tries yelling, using puppets, nothing works. He finally just falls asleep too.\n**Voice (waking up with a snort):** "—and that's why we... huh? Oh no. I lost them. And myself. If your safety talk is boring, it's also useless! Ask a question! Juggle something! ANYTHING BUT MONOTONE!"` },

A single drop flies out and lands on a tiny houseplant next to him, which comically wilts and turns to dust.\n**Voice (eyes wide with terror):** "Poor Fern... he had a family. Unlabeled containers are playing Russian Roulette with chemistry! Don't be the reason a fern's life is tragically cut short. LABEL. EVERYTHING."` },

He holds it up proudly, but the wind blows and the green paint flakes off, revealing the sad, brown leaf underneath. He looks embarrassed.\n**Voice:** "See? It looks good from a distance, but up close it's just... sad. And flaky. That's greenwashing! Real sustainability has roots, people! DATA! Not a cheap coat of paint! Now everyone knows my secret..."` },

A single drop of water drips from the ceiling, but it sounds like a cannon blast. He jumps, terrified, and hides under a desk.\n**Voice:** "WHAT WAS THAT?! Oh. It's just a drip. But when you're alone, every little sound is a monster under the bed! Stay aware, stay calm, and for goodness sake, fix the leak before I have a heart attack!"` },

He starts to imagine everyone else is inside having a party without him. He checks his tiny watch, looking sad.\n**Voice:** "So this is it. The end of the line. Forgotten. The muster point isn't just a place, it's a headcount! It's how we know you're safe and not... missing the post-crisis pizza party. Wait, is there a pizza party?"` },
